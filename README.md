## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took on this project specifically so I could learn to use the Grid better, and I'd say in that respect it was a success, as I managed to end the project with a greater familiarity with the tool. It was a very simple project, I don't have much to point out.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on tightening my CSS in general, seeing as I still feel like the code could be shorter and more efficiency. I especially feel like I may be wasting too much space on writing single positioning lines for isolated components, and would like to start figuring out a way to do this more efficiently.
